# Race Conditions 

To run this program, use the following commands in your terminal/shell:

"$ javac RaceConditionDemo.java"   // Compiles and generates .class file
"$ java RaceConditionDemo" // runs program

The program will halt after 50 loop iterations or until it hits a race condition (practically guaranteed in this build)
