# Semaphore Demonstration

Demonstration of using Semaphores to eliminate Race Conditions in a classic producer & consumer shared buffer problem.

How to run:
In the directory of RaceConditionDemo.java type the following commands (requires Java):

"$ javac RaceConditionDemo.java"  // Generates .class file
"$ java  RaceConditionDemo"       // Runs program

Be aware that the program prints a decent amount of output to the console when there is no race condition.
